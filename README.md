The designs for the associated custom 3D printed components can be downloaded from [here](https://www.printables.com/model/1288474-3wd-rpi-flex-pcb-robot).

A new design for the custom PCB is now used in this build, with images shown below, and the KiCAD design as gerber files can be downloaded from the 'PCB_design_files' folder.
